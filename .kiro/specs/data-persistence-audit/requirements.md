# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ESG platform currently has a comprehensive frontend interface with multiple modules (B0-B11, C1-C9) for collecting ESG data, along with a robust backend API and MongoDB database. However, there are gaps in ensuring that all user-entered data is properly persisted to the database. This feature addresses the need for comprehensive data persistence validation and implementation across all ESG modules to ensure no user input is lost and all data flows correctly from frontend forms to database storage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an ESG data manager, I want all form data I enter across any ESG module to be automatically saved to the database, so that I never lose my work and can continue where I left off.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters data in any form field in modules B0-B11 or C1-C9 THEN the system SHALL automatically save the data to the database within 5 seconds
2. WHEN a user navigates away from a form with unsaved changes THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to save their changes
3. WHEN a user returns to a previously filled form THEN the system SHALL display all previously saved data
4. WHEN form data is saved THEN the system SHALL provide visual confirmation of successful save operation
5. IF a save operation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and retain the data in the form for retry

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to audit all data persistence points in the application, so that I can ensure complete data integrity and identify any missing save operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conducting a data persistence audit THEN the system SHALL identify all form inputs that lack database save functionality
2. WHEN reviewing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL verify that all module update endpoints properly persist data to MongoDB
3. WHEN examining frontend components THEN the system SHALL confirm that all form submissions call appropriate backend APIs
4. WHEN validating data models THEN the system SHALL ensure all form fields have corresponding database schema fields
5. IF any data persistence gaps are found THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive report with specific remediation steps

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an ESG report creator, I want my calculation results and computed values to be automatically saved alongside my input data, so that I can track the complete audit trail of my ESG metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN emissions calculations are performed THEN the system SHALL save both input parameters and calculated results to the database
2. WHEN workforce metrics are computed THEN the system SHALL persist all demographic data and calculated percentages
3. WHEN scope 1, 2, or 3 emissions are calculated THEN the system SHALL store detailed breakdown data with timestamps
4. WHEN real-time previews are generated THEN the system SHALL optionally save preview calculations for audit purposes
5. IF calculation data is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain version history of previous calculations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive audit trails for all data changes, so that I can demonstrate data integrity and track who made what changes when.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any ESG data is created or modified THEN the system SHALL record the user ID, timestamp, and change details
2. WHEN data is deleted or archived THEN the system SHALL maintain audit records of the deletion with justification
3. WHEN bulk data operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log each individual change within the bulk operation
4. WHEN accessing audit trails THEN the system SHALL provide filtering and search capabilities by user, date, and module
5. IF audit data is requested THEN the system SHALL export complete audit trails in standard formats (JSON, CSV)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with intermittent internet connectivity, I want my data to be saved locally when offline and synchronized when connection is restored, so that I can continue working without data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN internet connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL continue to accept and store form data locally
2. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically synchronize local data with the database
3. WHEN conflicts arise during synchronization THEN the system SHALL present conflict resolution options to the user
4. WHEN working offline THEN the system SHALL provide clear indicators of offline status and pending sync operations
5. IF synchronization fails THEN the system SHALL retry automatically and provide manual sync options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want all ESG module data to follow consistent validation and storage patterns, so that I can reliably query and analyze the data across different modules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is submitted from any ESG module THEN the system SHALL apply consistent validation rules before database storage
2. WHEN storing module data THEN the system SHALL use standardized field naming conventions and data types
3. WHEN persisting calculated values THEN the system SHALL include metadata about calculation methods and emission factors used
4. WHEN saving temporal data THEN the system SHALL consistently store timestamps in UTC format with timezone information
5. IF data validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages indicating which fields need correction

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an ESG manager, I want all saved data to be immediately visible on the dashboard and summary views, so that I can see real-time progress and data completeness across all ESG modules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is saved in any ESG module THEN the system SHALL immediately update the main dashboard with the new information
2. WHEN viewing module completion status THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress indicators based on saved data
3. WHEN accessing summary reports THEN the system SHALL include all recently saved data without requiring page refresh
4. WHEN data is updated in a module THEN the system SHALL refresh related dashboard widgets and charts automatically
5. IF dashboard data appears stale THEN the system SHALL provide manual refresh options and indicate last update timestamps

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user accessing the dashboard landing page, I want to see a properly functioning overview with accurate data from all modules, so that I can quickly assess my ESG reporting progress and identify areas needing attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard landing page THEN the system SHALL display accurate summary statistics from all completed ESG modules
2. WHEN viewing the B0 (General Company Information) module THEN the system SHALL properly load, save, and display all company data fields
3. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL show real-time completion percentages for each ESG module based on saved data
4. WHEN company information is updated in B0 THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect changes in dashboard company overview cards
5. IF any dashboard components fail to load THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and fallback content
